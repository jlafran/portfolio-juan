              <p className="regular">This project was done for a university subject with 3 partners, this was developed throught 4 months from the idea to a fully working prototype. My role as a fullstack developer meant that i was responsible for the whole development of the project. But it also meant that i was able to choose the language and technologies to work with.</p>
              <p className="medium">And I was back to the MERN Stack <span> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span> </p>

              <h1 className="semibold" >The Problem</h1>
              <p className="regular">First we bainstormed to get a great problem. We arrived to an issue that bothered all 3 of us. It was bugs in games!!!</p>
              <p className="regular">Then we proceeded to investigate the main issues that causes games filled with bugs. And through a questionnaire and various interviews with a project managers in gaming studios, we were able to pin point two main problems with small and medium gaming studios:</p>
              <p className="list-items regular">Lack of mass testing before launch.</p>
              <p className="list-items regular">Unavailable to hire large teams of full time testers.</p>

Also it was my first time doing unit testing, so that was a beast of it's own, but it really helped specially for developing CRUD request and Mocha made it easier.</p>
              <p className="regular" >Once I managed to get the hang of it, and finished the backend I started with the frontend. Using my partners designs and wireframes, we were able to achieve a clean look&feel. It also helped that I previously worked with React.</p>
